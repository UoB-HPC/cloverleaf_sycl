//  @brief CloverLeaf top level program: Invokes the main cycle
//  @author Wayne Gaudin
//  @details CloverLeaf in a proxy-app that solves the compressible Euler
//  Equations using an explicit finite volume method on a Cartesian grid.
//  The grid is staggered with internal energy, density and pressure at cell
//  centres and velocities on cell vertices.
//
//  A second order predictor-corrector method is used to advance the solution
//  in time during the Lagrangian phase. A second order advective remap is then
//  carried out to return the mesh to an orthogonal state.
//
//  NOTE: that the proxy-app uses uniformly spaced mesh. The actual method will
//  work on a mesh with varying spacing to keep it relevant to it's parent code.
//  For this reason, optimisations should only be carried out on the software
//  that do not change the underlying numerical method. For example, the
//  volume, though constant for all cells, should remain array and not be
//  converted to a scalar.
